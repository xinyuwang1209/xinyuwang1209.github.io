I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Connecticut. I previously completed a dual degree in Computer Science & Engineering and Mathematics at UConn. I began my research journey in the Laboratory of Machine Learning & Health Informatics, where I developed a strong interest in machine learning, which continues to be my primary research focus.
