## Depression Discovery
* A Machine Learning Study on the Relational modeling between Brain MRI and Genotypes of Depression.

## Machine Learning In Drug Discovery and Development
* A research on applying artificial intelligence to drug discovery by developing innovative approaches to incorporate biochemical knowledge derived from data for drug development.
* Investigated the effectiveness of applying OctNet convolutional network on representing 3D structures of molecules, and analyzed the performances between tSNE and UMAP algorithms applied on dimension reduction of molecule features.  
* Currently work on designing a generalized web-based visualization interface for interactive presentation of clustered molecules for demonstration and analysis purpose.

## Secure Inter-Domain Routing - RPKI/ROV Forecast Web-Service
* Currently work on designing and building a software that provides forecast service for Internet Service Providers to predict potential impact of adopting specific policies with RPKI. Expect to complete the product by the end of 2018.
## “A Provable Multi-linear Model for Tensor Completion Using Auxiliary Features”
* A research on improving the performance of Tensor completion with Side information (TECOS). A stochastic process is implemented in TECOS to achieve sublinear convergence rate by relaxing the constraints instead of objective functions.
* Coauthors: Jin Lu, Jiangwen Sun, Xinyu Wang, Jinbo Bi.
* Submitted to International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2018).


## “Collaborative Phenotype Inference from Comorbid Substance Use Disorders and Genotypes”
* A research on predicting symptoms of comorbid conditions using matrix completion method. A stochastic and parallel algorithm LADMM (Linearized  Alternating Direction Method) is developed to solve this problem with  significant improvement on both efficiency and accuracy compared with other existing algorithms.
* Contribution: Tested performances of different matrix completion algorithms (extended to tensor completion algorithms in the later project) in large-scale genetic studies of substance use disorders.
* Coauthors: Jin Lu, Jiangwen Sun, Xinyu Wang, Jinbo Bi.
* Submitted to and accepted by IEEE BIBM 2017.
* Invited to publish an extended version on ISVOS Journal.

## Secure Inter-Domain Routing - SmartValidator
* A research on protocols to secure inter-domain  routing based on current Borderless Gateway Protocol (BGP) and Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).
* Reviewed and improved the performance of SmartValidator2, a software designed by former researchers to handle conflicted BGP announcements smoothly. 
Plan on cooperating with Comcast and testing the RPKI smart validator on their network.

## Parameter Optimization for LADMM using Inverse Method with Neural Network
* A Study on solving the difficulty of locating best parameters during the experiment on the LADMM algorithm using a framework implemented based on a published paper which applied neural network on the traditional inverse method.
Implemented LADDM algorithm in Python for future study of solving linear inverse problems suing deep projection models.

* Currently Suspended the project and plan to continue on this study next year.
